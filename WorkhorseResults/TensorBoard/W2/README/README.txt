Experiment start time: Thu May 17 14:56:44 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Made the model have a funnel shape shape.

Reasoning:
The double layer identical shape was, uh, a bug..

Hypothesis:
Even if there was a bug, the better shape should make a non negligable difference.

Results:
It did not. The signifant change between layer diffences. A small bottleneck doesnt seem to affect anything.
