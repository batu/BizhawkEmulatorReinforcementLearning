Experiment start time: Wed May 16 15:34:48 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Reduced the gamme to .9 (from .99)

Reasoning:
We do not need long term planning, we just want the agent to be more reactive. Shorter horizon should give us that

Hypothesis:
The training will make the agent more reactive stable.

Results:
