Experiment start time: Thu May 17 11:09:01 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Made the model 1 layer deeper.

Reasoning:
The single layer, even after the model, seems too shallow. I want to fine tune a bit better, and specifically, I am curious if there are any differences between 1 layer and 2 layers.

Hypothesis:
There will not be any significant changes between a single layer and double layer set up.

Results:
Max reward average definitely increased compared to a single layer set up!
