Experiment start time: Fri May 18 00:29:10 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Changed, overnight, to have a 4^k 3^k 2^k dense structure.

Reasoning:
Even now it gets to a max reward floor. I want to see if a bigger network with longer training can help it figure something out.

Hypothesis:
To be honest I dont expect a categorigal change.

Results:
