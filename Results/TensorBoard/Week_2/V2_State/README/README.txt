Experiment start time: Thu May 17 12:09:00 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Increased the state space back to 1024, 1 concatination to 4.

Reasoning:
The timeline information between frames can still be useful. The better understanding of the model makes things checkout.

Hypothesis:
The agent will be more reactive(aka understand direction better).

Results:
Much better looking graphs
