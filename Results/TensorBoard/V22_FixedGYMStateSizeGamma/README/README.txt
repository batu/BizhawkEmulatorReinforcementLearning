Experiment start time: Thu May 31 17:04:41 2018

Algorithm:
DQN.

The Changes:
Week three. To start off I fixed the gym state size. It was not between 0 and 1. I do not knw what discere(min,max) does but if it is clipping it might be huge! Also changed the gamma to only think about 12 actions into the future, 2.5 seconds

Reasoning:
 Lets see if this changes anything

Hypothesis:
DQN will show signs of life.

Results:
